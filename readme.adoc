A comprehensive hands-on tutorial explaining building docker image when images are push on github

== Create Your GitHub Repo and Add a Dockerfile

. The first step is, obviously, to setup your repository on GitHub

. Enabling Automated Builds on Docker Hub

	To enable automated builds you need to connect your Docker Hub account with your account on GitHub. 
	- Login to Docker Hub and go to 
	- Account Settings > Linked Accounts.
	- Scroll-down to find GitHub and click on the Connect link. 
	You will be taken through the usual OAuth process where you login to GitHub (if not already logged-in) and authorise Docker to access your GitHub repositories. 
	If everything goes well, you should receive a notification from GitHub (via email saying that A third-party OAuth application (Docker Hub Builder)  ....

. create the Docker Hub repository and link it to your GitHub repository

	- name your repo
	- Choose GitHub repo
	- Set up build rules
		1- A "tag rule" allows Docker Hub to start building an image upon discovery of a new tag in our git repository : Source = /^[0-9.]+$/ and Docker Tag = {sourceref}
		2- A "Branch rule" allows Docker Hub to start building an image upon activity on a specific branch. Source = "Master" and Dokcer Tag = latest
